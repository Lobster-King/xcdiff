xcdiff is an extensible tool that finds differences between your `.xcodeproj` project files. It allows you add comparators of your own very easily.

## How to Use

Running the command xcdiff in your project directory will search for two `.xcodeproj` files in this directory and use all of `xcdiff`'s comparators on the projects (some of which are file references, targets and headers for example).

You can specify two particular projects `xcdiff` will compare.
```
xcdiff -p1 "path/to/project1.xcodeproj" -p2 "path/to/project2.xcodeproj"
```

### Output a Different Format

Since there is a lot of information stored in a `.xcodeproj` file comparisons can get verbose. We provide output format options to make reading the output easier.
```
xcdiff -f markdown # alternatively json or console
```

### View a List of All Comparators

`xcdiff` has an option to view all the comparators currently implemented.
```
xcdiff -l
```

###  Compare Specific Configurations

Xcode projects can have a lot of configurations so you can specify a particular configuration to compare.
```
xcdiff -c "Beta"
```

### Compare Specific Targets

Large projects can have many targets and you may be interested in only a few of them. Use a comma seperated list to specify many targets.
```
xcdiff -t "Target1, Target2"
```

### Compare Any Specific Difference Type

xcdiff uses the notion of `tags` to identify the different types of comparisons it can make. Since you might be interested in looking for a specific type of difference whether it is `targets` or `file references` we added the ability to compare by tag.

```
xcdiff -l # you can use -l to find all the comparators available
xcdiff -g "TARGETS"
xcdiff -g "CONFIGURATIONS"
```

### SwiftLint

We've set up SwiftLint (https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce Swift style and conventions.
You can run the following command to check if your code does not violate any of the rules.

```
swiftlint
```

### SwiftFormat

We've set up SwiftFormat (https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) to enforce consistent code formatting.

You can run the following command to format your code.

```
swiftformat .
```

### Command Tests

All markdown files in `CommandTests/Manual` were created manually, `CommandTests/Generated` contains test files that are auto-generated by the script `Scripts/generate_tests_commands_files.py`. Thanks to those tests, there is no need to write any new manual tests. We need to just focus on reviewing the new markdown files generated in `CommandTests/Generated` to make sure the files contain the expected output of your new comparator. Scan the file names in `CommandTests/Generated` for your new dependency tag name or check `git status` for new markdown files if you have trouble finding the newly generated files by the script.

**IMPORTANT:** To add a new comparator add the comparator's tag to `Scripts/generate_tests_commands_files.py` and run the script to generate the tests. The script needs to be updated and run every time we add a new comparator.

Each markdown file in `CommandTests` represents a single integration test. Those files follow a very specific pattern:

```
    # Command
    ```json
    <JSON REPRESENTATION OF THE COMMAND>
    ```

    # Expected exit code
    <NUMBER>

    # Expected output
    ```
    <CONTENT OF THE OUTPUT>
    ```
```

i.e.

```
    # Command
    ```json
    ["-p1", "{ios_project_1}", "-p2", "{ios_project_2}"]
    ```

    # Expected exit code
    1

    # Expected output
    ```
    ❌ TARGETS > NATIVE targets
    ❌ TARGETS > AGGREGATE targets
    ❌ SOURCES > "Project" target
    ❌ SOURCES > "ProjectTests" target
    ❌ SOURCES > "ProjectUITests" target
    ❌ RESOURCES > "Project" target
    ❌ RESOURCES > "ProjectTests" target
    ❌ RESOURCES > "ProjectUITests" target


    ```
```

`generate_tests_commands_files.py` helps to generate the most obvious cases, like different permutations of the verbose or format options.
